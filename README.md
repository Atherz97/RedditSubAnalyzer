# RedditSubAnalyzer
Reads the comments in a subreddit for good and bad adjectives, to see overall trends in selected communities.

Post your subreddit list with one sub per line in a file called sublist.txt, and run the python file. Every fixed interval, this script will fetch and "evaluate" each subreddit, as well as prints a statistics file for further analysis.

Not sure if the formatting of the output will be ruined on Windows.
